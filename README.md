Welcome to the Snake Game, a captivating C++ program that combines the thrill of gaming with the power of Data Structures and Algorithms! In this game, you'll witness the magic of DSA concepts like linked lists as you control a snake through a maze. The snake's body is dynamically created using a linked list data structure, allowing it to grow and shrink as it devours food. As you navigate the snake across the game board, the program cleverly animates its movement, giving you a real-time visual experience. With each mouth-watering morsel consumed, the snake's body dynamically expands, showcasing the power of linked list manipulation. Utilizing these DSA concepts adds depth and complexity to the gameplay, offering an engaging and challenging experience. Prepare yourself for an adventure that will test your strategic thinking, reflexes, and mastery of DSA as you strive for the highest score in this mesmerizing snake game!
